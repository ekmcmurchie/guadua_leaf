	-The file 'specimen_data.xlsx' contains basic information about all specimens used in this study. These data include specimen collector and number, species (and subspecies, when applicable) identification, country in which specimens were collected, general habit for the species, general habitat for the species, herbarium at which the specimen is deposited, photographer (Elizabeth K. McMurchie, EKM, or Lynn G. Clark, LGC) who imaged each floral bract and/or foliage leaf specimen, which researcher (Elizabeth K. McMurchie, EKM, or Josephine A. Crock, JAC) categorized presence/absence of micromorphological features on foliage leaves and floral bracts, and metal sputter coating used on foliage leaves and floral bracts (Au, gold, Pt, platinum, or Ir, iridium) prior to imaging. 
	
	-The file 'Appendix A data_dictionary_leaf.docx' contains the data dictionary for foliage leaf micromorphology classification. This includes the definitions for all variables used in 'guadua_leaf_raw_3.xlsx'. Variables are primarily defined with reference to Ellis (1979), with additional reference to Cunha Santana (2017) and ICPT (2019).

	-The file 'Appendix B data_dicitonary_floret.docx' contains the data dictionary for floral bract micromorphology classification. This includes the definitions for all variables used in 'guadua_lemmas_paleas_raw_3.xlsx'. Variables are primarily defined with reference to Ellis (1979), with additional reference to Cunha Santana (2017) and ICPT (2019).
